Inventory Management System 

Problem Statement 

Imagine a shop owner running a grocery store or a hardware shop. Every day they need to keep track of:

what items are in stock

what items are running low

what’s selling the most

how much to reorder

and whether the records written in notebooks or Excel sheets are even correct

Because everything is handled manually, small mistakes add up.
Suddenly the shop runs out of a product people want, or they end up buying extra stock that sits on the shelf for months.

This leads to loss of money, confusion, and a lot of stress.

Many small businesses face this exact problem.

How the Inventory Management System Helps 

The Inventory Management System is like a smart assistant for the shop.

Whenever a product is added, sold, or updated, the system automatically adjusts the stock.
The owner can open the website and instantly know:

“How many units do I have left?”

“Which items are almost finished?”

“Which products sell the most?”

“How much did I sell today?”

It removes the need for paper records or guessing.

Why It’s Useful
1. Saves Time

No more counting shelves every day.
No more searching through notebooks.
The system handles everything automatically.

2. Reduces Mistakes

Humans make mistakes.
The system doesn’t.
Numbers stay accurate.

3. Prevents Stock Shortages

It alerts the shop owner when items are running low so they can restock on time.

4. Better Decisions

The system shows sales reports and trends so the owner knows:

what to buy more of

what customers like

how business is growing

5. Works for Any Shop

From grocery stores to clothing shops, pharmacies to warehouses —
any business that sells products can use it.
